# Ray-Tracer
Done for C++ practice and because I like graphics processing. A simple ray tracer based on my knowledge from CS184 at Berkeley where I first made a ray tracer, and this great tutorial! https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html
Will be adding more features in the future such as BVH, gpu and cpu level parallelism, materials, surface textures, importance sampling, etc. Stay tuned!
